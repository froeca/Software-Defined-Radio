# Cheap Software Defined Radio Receiver Project

**Introduction:** This repository covers the design of a simple, low-cost software defined radio (SDR) receiver to be used in conjunction with [Quisk](https://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/), a free open source SDR software. This project was created in partial fulfillments of ENGR 357 "Engineering Electronics II" at Walla Walla University. I worked with [Konrad McClure](https://github.com/KonradMcClure) to build our (5.000 MHz - 10.000 MHz) radio receiver. For more information on the theory and circuit design, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/froeca/Software-Defined-Radio/wiki).

**Credits:** As mentioned previously, I completed this project with fellow ENGR 357 student, Konrad McClure. We also recived a lot of help from, [Dr. Rob Frohne](https://github.com/frohro/), our professor. The files in the IQ_SDR repository have been forked from his repository: (https://github.com/frohro/). 

**Status of My Project:** Currently, my clock generator (SI5351) is broken and I am waiting to get some more another one in the mail before I continue testing. I hope to recieve these ICs by the end of the week. I have [tested each of the components](https://github.com/froeca/Software-Defined-Radio/wiki/5.-Construction-and-Testing#testing) of my circuit and even hooked it up to [Quisk for a short time](https://github.com/froeca/Software-Defined-Radio/blob/master/Images/quisk_clip.MOV), but I haven't been able to take final result measurement or tune into a station. My project partner, [Konrad McClure](https://github.com/KonradMcClure), currently has a working reciever.

**Contact Information:** I hope this information helps you learn more about radio reciever design. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email at: Caleb.Froelich@wallawalla.edu. All the best in your electronics endeavors!


**UPDATE (Aug. 2020):** My project partner and I (along with our professor and another two Electrical Engineering students ([Jordyn Watkins](https://github.com/greenjacketgirl) and [Josh Silver](https://github.com/JoshSilver8)) wrote a paper that was featured in the [39th Annual ARRL and TAPR Digital Communications Conference](https://tapr.org/papers-of-the-2020-arrl-tapr-digital-communications-conference-dcc/), [SolderSmoke](http://soldersmoke.blogspot.com/2020/09/mixer-insights-using-propellers-and.html), and is being translated into spanish to be published in the [Unión de Radioaficionados Españoles (URE)](https://www.ure.es) journal, a national Spanish amateur radio association. A video of our presentation at the TAPR DCC can be found on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoL1Qzaw2H0&t=217s).
