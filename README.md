# Cheap Software Defined Radio Project

**Introduction:** This repository covers the design of a simple, low-cost software defined radio (SDR) receiver to be used in conjunction with Quisk, a free open source SDR software. This project was created in partial fulfillments of ENGR 357 "Engineering Electronics II" at Walla Walla University. I worked with Konrad McClure (https://github.com/KonradMcClure) to build the (5.000 MHz - 10.000 MHz) radio receiver. For more information on the theory and circuit design, please see the Wiki.

**Credits:** As mentioned previously, I completed this project with fellow ENGR 357 student, Konrad McClure. We also recived a lot of help from, Dr. Rob Frohne, our professor. The files in the SDR have been forked from his repository: (https://github.com/frohro/).
